# basic-html
My first roadmap.sh project and learning GitHub - basic html

This is my first project from roadmap.sh. The title of this project is called "Basic HTML Website"
[https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-html-website]

It's a basic HTML layout with multiple pages and no CSS styling.
Feel free to check it out and leave feedbacks on how I can improve.
